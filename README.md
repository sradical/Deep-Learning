# Udacity-Deep-Learning
Projects for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

1. Used AWS Sagemaker to construct a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page then sends the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
2. Developed an algorithm to determine dog breed from user supplied image
3. Used Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) to train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces and train to the generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. 
4. Used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate a new "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
